The frontend is based on React, Semantic UI, Apollo Client while the backend is based on NodeJs, GraphQL with Apollo Server and MongoDB serving as a database.

The schema is laid using GraphQL and Apollo Server. The front end communicates with the server using Apollo Client and the server performs the major authentications. 

It's a CRUD Application and it has a login and register page. The home page displays all the posts but the ability to post is only given to the users logged in and have their valid tokens which the backend created. Users can also like, comment on posts and delete their own posts  and comments.
